**This project implements a convolutional autoencoder for dimensionality reduction on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. Key features and implementation details include:**

* **Preprocessing Functions:**
    * **Data loading:**  Efficient reading of the MNIST binary file format using the `struct` module, handling the dataset's specific structure (magic number, image dimensions).
    * **Normalization:** Converts pixel values to the  [0, 1] range for better network training and stability.
    * **Reshaping:** Adds a channel dimension to the images, making them compatible with the convolutional layers of the autoencoder. 

* **Customizable Autoencoder Architecture:**
    * **Flexible Convolutional Layers:** Allows adjustment of the number of convolutional layers, filter sizes, and filters per layer, enabling experimentation for optimal encoding.
    * **Regularization:** Includes BatchNormalization to improve generalization and Dropout to prevent overfitting. 
    * **Nonlinearity:** Utilizes LeakyReLU activations for efficient gradient flow during training.
    * **Latent Representation:** The Dense layer in the encoder compresses the input into a lower-dimensional latent code, capturing the essential features of the images.

* **Training Process:**
    * **Loss Function:** Employs mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate image reconstruction quality.
    * **Adaptive Optimization:** Uses the Adam optimizer for efficient parameter updates during training.
    * **Early Stopping:** Prevents overfitting by terminating the training process when validation loss plateaus or increases.
    * **Dynamic Learning Rate:** Implements the ReduceLROnPlateau callback to reduce the learning rate when validation loss stagnates, improving convergence.

* **Encoding and Saving Functions:**
    * **Image Encoding:** The encoder model extracts compact representations from new images, suitable for downstream tasks.
    * **Custom File Format:** Creates a custom binary file format with a unique magic number to store encoded vectors, ensuring compatibility and avoiding confusion with the original MNIST data.
    * **Normalization:** Scales the encoded vectors to the [0, 255] range, facilitating visualization or use with other image processing tools.
