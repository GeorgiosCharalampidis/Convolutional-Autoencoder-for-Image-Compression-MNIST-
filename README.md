* "This project implements a convolutional autoencoder for dimensionality reduction on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. It includes:
   * Preprocessing functions for MNIST data.
   * A customizable autoencoder architecture.
   * Training with early stopping and learning rate adjustment.
   * Functions to encode new images and save encoded representations to a custom file format."
